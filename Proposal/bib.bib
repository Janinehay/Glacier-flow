abstract = {We propose and implement a new method, called the Ice Sheet Coupled Approximation Levels (ISCAL) method, for simulation of ice sheet flow in large domains during long time-intervals. The method couples the full Stokes (FS) equations with the Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA). The part of the domain where SIA is applied is determined automatically and dynamically based on estimates of the modeling error. For a three dimensional model problem, ISCAL computes the solution substantially faster with a low reduction in accuracy compared to a monolithic FS. Furthermore, ISCAL is shown to be able to detect rapid dynamic changes in the flow. Three different error estimations are applied and compared. Finally, ISCAL is applied to the Greenland Ice Sheet on a quasi-uniform grid, proving ISCAL to be a potential valuable tool for the ice sheet modeling community.}

abstract = {The glaciers of western Canada and the conterminous United States have dominantly retreated since the end of the Little Ice Age (LIA) in the nineteenth century, although average rates of retreat varied from strong in the first‐half of the twentieth century, with glaciers stabilizing or even advancing until 1980, and then resuming consistent recession. This retreat has been accompanied by statistically detectable declines in late‐summer streamflow from glacier‐fed catchments over much of the study area, although there is some geographical variation: over recent decades, glaciers in northwest BC and southwest Yukon have lost mass dominantly by thinning with relatively low rates of terminal retreat, and glacier‐fed streams in that region have experienced increasing flows. In many valleys, glacier retreat has produced geomorphic hazards, including outburst floods from moraine‐dammed lakes, mass failures from oversteepened valley walls and debris flows generated on moraines. In addition to these hydrologic and geomorphic changes, evidence is presented that glacier retreat will result in higher stream temperatures, possibly transient increases in suspended sediment fluxes and concentrations, and changes in water chemistry. With climate projected to continue warming over the twenty‐first century, current trends in hydrology, geomorphology and water quality should continue, with a range of implications for water resources availability and management and hydroecology, particularly for cool and cold‐water species such as salmonids.

abstract = {Several different approaches of various complexities have been used in glacier and ice sheet modelling studies. Amongst them, owing to its simplicity, the Shallow Ice Approximation appears to be the most widely adopted method. This approach, essentially used for ice sheets, owes its success to the shallow aspect of the modelled ice mass embodied in an aspect ratio ζ. When considering smaller ice bodies like alpine-type glaciers, the question arises as to whether the SIA is still valid, given that the method is all the more accurate as ζ is small. In order to test the domain of applicability of the method, results of a SIA finite difference model are compared to those of a finite element model in which the flow equations are fully considered. From a set of two-dimensional flow tests, it is shown that the accuracy of the method is much more deteriorated with increasing bedrock slopes than it is with increasing accumulation rates, even if higher accumulations lead to thicker glaciers with a larger ζ. This leads to the conclusion that when slopes become pronounced, it is a bedrock-related aspect ratio that becomes of relevance such that the bedrock slope should be the most important parameter to consider for assessing the validity of the SIA Method. A 3-dimensional simulation shows that longitudinal shear stresses explain a large part of the misfit between SIA and full-Stokes approaches. To cite this article: E. Le Meur et al., C. R.

Résumé
De nombreuses approches, plus ou moins complexes, sont envisageables pour modéliser l'écoulement des glaciers et des calottes polaires. Parmi ces méthodes, l'approximation de la couche mince (Shallow Ice Approximation, SIA) semble être la plus utilisée, notamment pour sa grande simplicité. La SIA, essentiellement utilisée pour modéliser l'écoulement des calottes polaires, repose sur le faible rapport d'aspect ζ caractéristique de ces objets glaciaires. Pour des objets plus petits, comme les glaciers Alpins, la question de l'applicabilité de la SIA se pose puisque sa validé diminue lorsque ζ augmente. Avec comme objectif de définir le domaine de validité de cette méthode, les résultats de la SIA sont comparés à ceux obtenus en résolvant complètement les équations de Stokes à l'aide d'un code aux éléments finis. A partir de tests bidimensionnels, on montre que la solution donnée par la SIA est plus détériorée lorsque la pente du socle augmente que lorsque l'accumulation augmente, même si une augmentation de l'accumulation conduit à une augmentation de ζ. Par conséquent, lorsque la pente du socle devient importante, c'est elle qui doit être considérée, et non plus le rapport d'aspect, indiquant que la pente est donc le plus sévère des critères de validité de la SIA pour les applications glaciaires. Des simulations tridimensionnelles montrent que la non prise en compte des contraintes de cisaillement longitudinal dans la SIA contribue significativement à la différence avec la solution complète de Stokes.

abstract = {Full Stokes ice sheet models provide the most accurate description of ice sheet flow, and can therefore be used to reduce existing uncertainties in predicting the contribution of ice sheets to future sea level rise on centennial time-scales. The level of accuracy at which millennial time-scale palaeo-ice sheet simulations resolve ice sheet flow lags the standards set by Full Stokes models, especially, when Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA) models are used. Most models used in paleo-ice sheet modeling were developed at a time when computer power was very limited, and rely on several assumptions. At the time there was no means of verifying the assumptions by other than mathematical arguments. However, with the computer power and refined Full Stokes models available today, it is possible to test these assumptions numerically. In this paper, we review (Ahlkrona et al., 2013a) where such tests were performed and inaccuracies in commonly used arguments were found. We also summarize (Ahlkrona et al., 2013b) where the implications of the inaccurate assumptions are analyzed for two paleo-models – the SIA and the SOSIA. We review these works without resorting to mathematical detail, in order to make them accessible to a wider audience with a general interest in palaeo-ice sheet modelling. Specifically, we discuss two implications of relevance for palaeo-ice sheet modelling. First, classical SIA models are less accurate than assumed in their original derivation. Secondly, and contrary to previous recommendations, the SOSIA model is ruled out as a practicable tool for palaeo-ice sheet simulations. We conclude with an outlook concerning the new Ice Sheet Coupled Approximation Level (ISCAL) method presented in Ahlkrona et al. (2016), that has the potential to match the accuracy standards of full Stokes model on palaeo-timescales of tens of thousands of years, and to become an alternative to hybrid models currently used in palaeo-ice sheet modelling. The method is applied to an ice sheet covering Svalbard.}

The daily energy fluxes were computed during melt seasons and correlated with each other and with air temperature on and outside the glacier. The relative contribution of each flux to the correlations between temperature and melt energy was assessed. At Zongo, net short-wave radiation controls the variability of the energy balance and is poorly correlated to temperature. On tropical glaciers, temperature remains low and varies little, melt energy is poorly correlated to temperature, and degree-day models are not appropriate to simulate daily melting. At the yearly scale, the temperature is better correlated to the mass balance because it integrates the ablation and the accumulation processes over a long time period. At Sorlin, the turbulent sensible heat flux is greater because of higher temperatures, but melt variability is still controlled by short-wave radiation. Temperature correlates well with melt energy mainly through short-wave radiation, probably because of diurnal advection of warm air from the valley. At Storglaciären, high correlations between temperature and melt energy result from substantial variability of the sensible and latent heat fluxes (which both supply energy to the glacier), and their good correlations with temperature. In the three climates, long-wave irradiance is the main source of energy, but its variability is small and poorly correlated to the temperature mainly because cloud emissions dominate its variability.},

We estimate the contribution potential of seasonally delayed glacier melt water to total water availability in large river systems. We find that the seasonally delayed glacier contribution is largest where rivers enter seasonally arid regions and negligible in the lowlands of river basins governed by monsoon climates. By comparing monthly glacier melt contributions with population densities in different altitude bands within each river basin, we demonstrate that strong human dependence on glacier melt is not collocated with highest population densities in most basins.},

abstract = {Summary
Glaciers are crucial in many countries where meltwater from glaciers is an important source of water for drinking water supply, irrigation, hydropower generation and the ecological system. Glaciers are also important indicators of climate change. They have been significantly altered due to the global warming and have subsequently affected the regional hydrological regime. However, few models are able to parameterise the dynamics of the glacier system and consequent runoff processes in glacier fed basins with desirable performance measures. To narrow this gap, we have developed an integrated approach by coupling a hydrological model (HBV) and a glacier retreat model (Δh-parameterisation) and tested this approach in three basins with different glacier coverage and subject to different climate and hydrologic regimes. Results show that the coupled model is able to give satisfactory estimations of runoff and glacier mass balance in the Nigardsbreen basin where the measured data are available to verify the results. In addition, the model can provide maps of snowpack distribution and estimate runoff components from glaciers.}

    abstract = {  This paper is concerned with a new theoretical approach to model grounded ice sheets in three dimensions. These are considered as polythermal, i.e. there will be regions with temperatures below the pressure melting point (‘cold ice’) and regions with temperatures exactly at the pressure melting point (‘temperate ice’). In the latter, small quantities of water may occur. Based on previous approaches, an improved theory of polythermal ice sheets is developed, which is founded on continuum–thermodynamic balance relations and jump conditions for mass, momentum and energy. The rheological behaviour is assumed to be that of an incompressible, nonlinear viscous and heat conducting fluid; because of the dependence of viscosity on temperature and on water content, the problem is thermo–mechanically coupled. After presenting analytic solutions for a simple geometry (ice sheet of uniform depth), the theory is subjected to a scaling procedure with the assumptions of a small aspect ratio (ratio between typical vertical dimension and typical horizontal dimension) and a small Froude number. This leads to the introduction of the polythermal shallow–ice approximation (SIA) equations. Finally, as an application of the model to a real problem, a numerically computed steady–state solution for the Greenland Ice Sheet under present climate conditions is presented and compared with the real ice sheet.  }

At least two sources of such exact solutions exist for the isothermal shallow ice-sheet equation: similarity solutions and solutions with 'compensatory accumulation'. In this paper, we derive new similarity solutions with non-zero accumulation. We also derive exact solutions with (i) sinusoidal-in-time accumulation and (ii) basal sliding. A specific test suite based on these solutions is proposed and used to verify a standard explicit finite-difference method. This numerical scheme is shown to reliably track the position of a moving margin while being characterized by relatively large thickness errors near the margin. The difficulty of approximating the margin essentially explains the rate of global convergence of the numerical method. A transformed version of the ice-sheet equation eliminates the singularity of the margin shape and greatly accelerates the convergence. We also use an exact solution to verify an often-used numerical approximation for basal sliding and we discuss improvements of existing benchmarks.},

abstract = {Abstract Mountain water resources management often requires hydrological models that need to handle both snow and ice melt. In this study, we compared two different model types for a partly glacierized watershed in central Switzerland: (1) an energy-balance model primarily designed for snow simulations; and (2) a temperature-index model developed for glacier simulations. The models were forced with data extrapolated from long-term measurement records to mimic the typical input data situation for climate change assessments. By using different methods to distribute precipitation, we also assessed how various snow cover patterns influenced the modelled runoff. The energy-balance model provided accurate discharge estimations during periods dominated by snow melt, but dropped in performance during the glacier ablation season. The glacier melt rates were sensitive to the modelled snow cover patterns and to the parameterization of turbulent heat fluxes. In contrast, the temperature-index model poorly reproduced snow melt runoff, but provided accurate discharge estimations during the periods dominated by glacier ablation, almost independently of the method used to distribute precipitation. Apparently, the calibration of this model compensated for the inaccurate precipitation input with biased parameters. Our results show that accurate estimates of snow cover patterns are needed either to correctly constrain the melt parameters of the temperature-index model or to ensure appropriate glacier surface albedos required by the energy-balance model. Thus, particularly when only distant meteorological stations are available, carefully selected input data and efficient extrapolation methods of meteorological variables improve the reliability of runoff simulations in high alpine watersheds.

Since air temperature generally is the most readily available data, such models have been the most widely used method of ice and snow melt computations for many purposes, such as hydrological modelling, ice dynamic modelling or climate sensitivity studies. Despite their simplicity, temperature-index models have proven to be powerful tools for melt modelling, often on a catchment scale outperforming energy balance models. However, two shortcomings are evident: (1) although working well over long time periods their accuracy decreases with increasing temporal resolution; (2) spatial variability cannot be modelled accurately as melt rates may vary substantially due to topographic effects such as shading, slope and aspect angles. These effects are particularly crucial in mountain areas. This paper provides an overview...},

This study reports the development of a physically-based simulation of snowmelt for a prairie environment. The spatial distribution of depth and water equivalent in prairie snowcovers is semi-fractal, being fractal at small-scales and random at scales greater than some characteristic cutoff length. When measurements of snow depth or water equivalent are taken at equal spacing along a transect the fractal variability causes the standard deviation to be a power function of sample size. The effects of fractal and random distributions on sampling and modelling prairie snowcovers are discussed. The spatial variability of snow depth and water equivalent is due to variations...},

abstract = {There are many models that attempt to predict physical processes in snow on the ground for a range of applications, and evaluations of these models show that they have a wide range of behaviours. A review of snow models, however, shows that many of them draw on a relatively small number of process parameterizations combined in different configurations and using different parameter values. A single model that combines existing parameterizations of differing complexity in many different configurations to generate large ensembles of simulations is presented here. The model is driven and evaluated with data from four winters at an alpine site in France. Consideration of errors in simulations of snow mass, snow depth, albedo and surface temperature show that there is no “best” model, but there is a group of model configurations that give consistently good results, another group that give consistently poor results, and many configurations that give good results in some cases and poor results in others. There is no clear link between model complexity and performance, but the most consistent results come from configurations that have prognostic representations of snow density and albedo and that take some account of storage and refreezing of liquid water within the snow.}
