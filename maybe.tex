When solving for an isothermal glacier, the SIA makes the assumptions the
\begin{itemize}
    \item the ice flow is uniform in the x-direction
    \item we are in a Steady-state configuration
    \item Glen's flow law is used
    \item the fluidity of the ice is independent of the temperature and water content of the ice
    \item acceleration is ignored
    \item the pressure dependency of ice melt is ignored
    \item water diffusion is ignored
    \item lithosphere influences are ignored
\end{itemize}
\citep{LEMEUR2004, Baral2001, Nye1952, Greve1997}. Using these assumptions, equation \ref{mass conservation} becomes
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d v_z}{dz} = 0
\end{equation}
